# RDFIA: Reconnaissance Des Formes par Intelligence Artificielle (Recognition and Description of Patterns with Artificial Intelligence)

This repository contains practical works (PW) I completed (with another student) as part of my master's course in deep learning for visual understanding (https://cord.isir.upmc.fr/teaching-rdfia/).
